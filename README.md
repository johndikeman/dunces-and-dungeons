# play the game from the command line
if you're on any post-xp version of windows, you can head over to the <a href='https://github.com/microwaveabletoaster/dunces-and-dungeons/releases'>release</a> page and download the latest binary for windows. if you're on some sort of *nix system, you're going to need to download the source code from the latest release, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `dunces-and-dungeons.py` with python 2.7.

the source code on the latest release is considered to be the most stable version, but might be behind on some features. clone the repo to play the game at your own risk!

# play WEBDUNCE
ever get tired of staring at a terminal, brainlessly pressing number keys for hours on end? we do too. so, we built webdunce! webdunce is a html frontend for our game, powered by the Flask framework, jquery ui, coffeescript, and redis- and let me tell you, it's pretty great.

however, as with many good things, this takes a little work to experience. luckily for you, i've laid it all out here in a handy <a href='WEBDUNCE.md'>guide</a>.

# about
dnd is a command-line randomly generated rpg with an emphasis on teamwork. players work together to defeat scores of monsters with unique qualities in sprawling procedurally generated dungeons, and collect plenty of loot in the process!

this repository was a project by cameron egger and john dikeman for their highschool independent study course, and isn't really being actively developed anymore. that being said, we would love to see some outside interest in the project! contact me at jrobdikeman@gmail.com if you're interested in becoming a collaborator.

we're working hard to make the internal documentation better, but at this stage you'll find that most things are commented in the code and everything is relatively easy to follow. if you have any specific questions, open an <a href="https://github.com/microwaveabletoaster/dunces-and-dungeons/issues">issue</a>.
