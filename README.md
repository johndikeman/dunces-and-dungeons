# play the game
if you're on any post-xp version of windows, you can head over to the <a href='https://github.com/microwaveabletoaster/dunces-and-dungeons/releases'>release</a> page and download the latest binary for windows. if you're on some sort of *nix system, you're going to need to download the source code from the latest release and run it with python 2.7.10- the game doesn't depend on any external libraries so you should be set from there.

the source code on the latest release is considered to be the most stable version, but might be behind on some features. clone the repo to play the game at your own risk! 

# about
