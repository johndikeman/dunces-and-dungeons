# play the game from the command line
if you're on any post-xp version of windows, you can head over to the <a href='https://github.com/microwaveabletoaster/dunces-and-dungeons/releases'>release</a> page and download the latest binary for windows. if you're on some sort of *nix system, you're going to need to download the source code from the latest release and run it with python 2.7.10- the game doesn't depend on any external libraries so you should be set from there.

the source code on the latest release is considered to be the most stable version, but might be behind on some features. clone the repo to play the game at your own risk! 

# play WEBDUNCE
ever get tired of staring at a terminal, brainlessly pressing number keys for hours on end? we do too. so, we built webdunce! webdunce is a html frontend for our game, powered by the Flask framework, jquery ui, coffeescript, and redis- and let me tell you, it's pretty great.

however, as with many good things, this takes a little work to experience. luckily for you, i've laid it all out here in a handy <a href='dunces-and-dungeons/WEBDUNCE.md'>guide</a>.

# about

dunces and dungeons is currently being developed by john dikeman and cameron egger as a project for their highschool independent study in computer science class.
